# This code uses a for loop to iterate through a tuple of numbers.
# If the number is odd (i % 2 != 0), it uses continue to
# skip the rest of the loop for that iteration.
# If the number is even, it prints that the number is even.
# The continue statement allows the loop to skip the current iteration and proceed to the next one.
# The output will show only the even numbers from the tuple.    
# The loop will print "Loop break." when it reaches 20 and then exit the loop.
# The loop will print numbers from 1 to 20, and then break out of the
# loop when it reaches 20, printing "Loop break." at that point.
# The loop will print "Countdown: 5" to "Countdown: 1" and then print "Countdown finished." when the countdown reaches 0.
# The loop will print "You entered: " followed by the value entered by the user until
