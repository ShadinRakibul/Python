# This code uses the match-case statement to handle different values of x.
# The match-case statement is a powerful feature in Python that allows for pattern matching.
# It can be used to simplify complex conditional logic.
# The underscore (_) acts as a wildcard, matching any value not explicitly handled by the previous cases.
# This code is a simple demonstration of how to use match-case in Python.
# The match-case statement is available in Python 3.10 and later.
